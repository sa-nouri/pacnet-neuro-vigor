# Parkinson's PAC Exploration with MV

This repository contains code and resources for predicting motor vigor from EEG Phase Amplitude Coupling (PAC) in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. The project explores the effects of dopaminergic medication and non-invasive modulation on motor vigor estimation using deep neural networks and statistical methods.

## Overview

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects motor function. Early intervention and accurate prediction of motor vigor can significantly improve the quality of life for PD patients. This project aims to predict motor vigor from EEG PAC in PD patients using deep learning and statistical methods.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Raw and processed data files.
- **models/**: Saved machine learning models.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis.
